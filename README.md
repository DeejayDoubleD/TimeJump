# TimeJump
A Small web-based jump'n run game made with HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

This was my first programming project back in 2021. Me and some friends programmed this small game for a school project.

To run the game, set up a webserver and simply open the index.html file from your webserver in a browser of your choice.
